## üéØ Design Choices & Assumptions

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

**Component Structure**
- **Functional Components with Hooks**: Used modern React patterns for better readability and testing
- **Context API for Theme Management**: Implemented global state for dark/light mode without over-engineering
- **Separation of Concerns**: Dedicated components for Search, Current Weather, Forecast, and UI elements

**State Management**
- **Local State**: Component-specific data (loading states, user input)
- **Context API**: Cross-component themes and user preferences
- **localStorage**: Persistent user settings (theme, unit preference, last city)

### üé® UI/UX Design Choices

**Responsive Design**
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Prioritized mobile experience with progressive enhancement
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: Modern layout techniques for consistent cross-device experience
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Weather-based gradient backgrounds for immersive experience

**User Experience**
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript enhancements
- **Graceful Degradation**: Features degrade elegantly when dependencies are unavailable
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during API calls and data processing

### üîß Technical Implementation

**API Integration**
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Reliable weather data source with comprehensive features
- **Axios HTTP Client**: Robust error handling and request management
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling of API failures and network issues

**Performance Optimization**
- **Efficient Re-renders**: Optimized dependency arrays and memoization
- **Smart Caching**: localStorage for user preferences and API response caching
- **Code Splitting**: Ready for lazy loading implementation

### ü§î Assumptions Made

**User Environment**
- Modern browsers with ES6+ support and geolocation capabilities
- Reasonable network connectivity for API calls
- Standard screen sizes and input methods

**Business Rules**
- Metric system (Celsius) as default temperature unit
- 5-day forecast provides sufficient planning information
- Current location detection enhances user experience

**Technical Constraints**
- OpenWeatherMap free tier rate limits are adequate
- localStorage availability for persistence
- React 18 compatibility and lifecycle understanding

### üîÆ Future Considerations

**Scalability**
- Component structure supports easy feature additions
- State management ready for complex data flows
- API layer prepared for multiple data sources

**Maintainability**
- Clear separation between presentation and logic
- Reusable utility functions and custom hooks
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

*These design choices prioritize user experience, code maintainability, and performance while making reasonable assumptions about the target environment and user needs.*
